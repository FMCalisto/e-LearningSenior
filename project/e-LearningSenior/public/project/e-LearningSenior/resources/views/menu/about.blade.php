    <h3>User Centered Design</h3>

    <p>

        User-centred design (UCD) is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.

    </p>

    <p>

        User-centred design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem solving process that not only requires designers to analyse and foresee how users are likely to use a product, but also to test the validity of their assumptions with regard to user behavior in real world tests with actual users at each stage of the process from requirements, concepts, pre-production models, mid production and post production creating a circle of proof back to and confirming or modifying the original requirements.

    </p>

    <p>

        Such testing is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of a product to understand intuitively what a first-time user of their design experiences, and what each user's learning curve may look like.

    </p>

    <p>

        The chief difference from other product design philosophies is that user-centered design tries to optimize the product around how users can, want, or need to use the product, rather than forcing the users to change their behavior to accommodate the product.

    </p>

    <h3>e-Learning</h3>

    <p>

        The e-Learning theory describes the cognitive science principles of effective multimedia learning using electronic educational technology.

    </p>

    <p>

        Cognitive research and theory suggest that selection of appropriate concurrent multimedia modalities may enhance learning, as may application of several other principles.

    </p>

    <h3>Gamification</h3>

    <p>

        The application of game elements a in non-gaming
        context offers a great potential regarding the
        engagement of senior citizens with information
        systems.

    </p>

    <p>

        On this project, we suggest the application of
        gamification to routine tasks and leisure activities,
        namely physical and cognitive therapy, the gamification
        of real-life activities which are no longer accessible due
        to age-related changes and the application of game
        design elements to foster social interaction.

    </p>

    <p>
        
        Furthermore, we point out important chances and
        challenges such as the lack of gaming experience
        among the target audience and highlight possible areas
        for future work which offer valuable design
        opportunities for frail elderly audiences.

    </p>


    <h3>Project</h3>

    <p>

        When developing user centred products, one of the very first concerns is to identify and characterize all users and user groups that may have an interest, be involved in or afected by the products' development and introduction into the market.
